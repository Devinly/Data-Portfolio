    "## **A1: Research Question** \n",
    "My research question is, \"Which services are most commonly preferred by married customers?\" This question aims to understand the service preferences of a specific customer demographic, specifically those married. By identifying the services that married customers choose, businesses can customize their marketing and offer services to meet the needs and preferences of this particular group. For example, businesses can create bundles and discounts based on these preferences, reducing the likelihood of married customers canceling their subscriptions. Additionally, they can also enhance the services that this group most values. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure satisfaction among married customers, retain their loyalty, and drive business growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **A2: Identifying Data** \n",
    "To answer the research question, using data from the original dataset and the created table is necessary. The tables used to answer this research question effectively are the “customer” table and the add-on “services” table. \n",
    "From the “customer” table, I focused on two columns: \"customer_id,\" which serves as a means to link matching customer records in the original dataset and the created table, and \"Marital,\" which provides information about the marital status of customers, which is needed for identifying those who are married. \n",
    "The \"Services\" Table also has a column labeled “customer_id”. This column is essential to locate customers in both tables. Furthermore, every column in the “services” table was ulitzed, as I needed to calculate the type and number of services each customer used. The columns within the “services” table include names such as “internetservice\" (DSL / Fiber Optic), \"phone,\" \"multiple,\" \"techsupport,\" \"onlinebackup,\" \"onlinesecurity,\" and \"deviceprotection.\" Collectively, these columns provide insights into the usage of different services among customers, contributing to the overall research analysis.

    "Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is an essential tool that provides a visual starting point for a database design; it is a basic design upon which the database is built. According to Vertabelo, ERDs “specify what data we will store: the entities and their attributes. They also show how entities relate to other entities (Team, 2021).” The ERD above effectively shows the many-to-many(m:n) relationships between entities, as demonstrated by the connection between 'customers' and 'cervices.' This feature is important for modeling situations where one entity is connected with multiple entries from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ERD also enforces relational constraints, such as primary and foreign keys. By implementing these constraints, it helps us to maintain data integrity. For instance, 'customer_id' is the primary key in the 'customers' table, guaranteeing each customer record has a unique identifier. Foreign keys in the 'cervices' table maintain links to the 'customers' table, preserving the relationships between customers and their chosen services. This tool is valuable in the initial design of our database and serves as an ongoing reference for database management, ensuring organized, reliable, and well-structured data. \n"

Instead of manually writing a SQL query, I used a GUI tool to assist in the process of creating a database table, defining its columns and their data types, and fulfilling other database-related tasks. While there are benefits to manually writing SQL queries, two advantages of using the GUI tool were to make the process more efficient and reduce the risk of errors or syntax mistakes. \n",
